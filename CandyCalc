//Here's the output:
This program will calculate the number of 230 calorie 
candy bars to eat to maintain your weight.
What is your age in years? 
35
What is your total height in inches? 
35
What is your total weight in pounds? 
35
Enter 'M' for male calculation or 'F' for female calculation.
Are you:
		A. Sedentary
		B. Somewhat active (exercise occasionally
		C. Active (exercise 3-4 days per week)
		D. Highly active (exercise every day)
Enter A,B,C, or D.
D
A female with those measurements should eat0.0candy bars per day to maintain the same weight.


So here's the problem:
Everything goes fine up until it asks to Enter 'M' or 'F' for male/female calculation. 
It outputs the line but skips over the user input. Sometimes it has an error right away
I tried opening up a new file and I literally copy pasted those 4 lines into it and it worked. But here it doesn't. 
So line 60 of the code is where it never works.
